# Pokemon Rewind
This project was created as part of the Rewind interview process.

## Running the app
To run this app you will need Docker installed. You can complete the following steps to run the app:
1. From the root directory, run `docker-compose up`
2. Get a coffee
3. Naviage to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser

## The App
The app consists of a client, server, and database. Client was written with React, server was written using Node.js, and the database I chose to use was MongoDB.

You can use the app itself by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/`. 

If you're using Postman and just want to test out a few of the routes, the server runs at `http://localhost:4000/`.

Finally, if you want to see how the collections are stored in a more visual format, you can check out `http://localhost:8081` for a database admin panel.
